# Exempted Attendance Feature Fix

## Problem Statement

The "exempted" attendance feature was incorrectly treating exempted absences as regular absences in all analytics, leaderboards, and statistics. This meant that:

- Exempted absences were reducing attendance percentages
- Exempted absences were breaking attendance streaks
- Exempted absences were counted in absence statistics
- Leaderboards were negatively impacted by exempted absences

## Solution

Exempted absences are now treated as "present" for analytics purposes while maintaining them as "absent" in the database for record-keeping. This ensures that:

- **Program managers** can mark students as absent but exempted for legitimate reasons
- **Analytics** treat exempted absences as attended sessions
- **Leaderboards** show accurate attendance percentages
- **Streaks** are not broken by exempted absences
- **Statistics** separate exempted absences from regular absences

## Visual Indicators and User Experience

### 1. Attendance Table Indicators
- **Shield Badge**: Students with exempted absences show a shield icon with "Exempted" badge
- **Button Text**: Absent button changes to "Exempted" when student has exempted absence
- **Tooltips**: Detailed tooltips explain the reason and impact of exempted absences
- **Color Coding**: Exempted absences use amber/orange color scheme to distinguish from regular absences

### 2. Leaderboard Indicators
- **Shield Badge**: Shows count of exempted absences next to student names
- **Info Icons**: Small info icons next to attendance percentages indicate exempted absences are included
- **Detailed Tooltips**: Explain how exempted absences impact rankings and calculations
- **Notice Banner**: Appears when any student has exempted absences, explaining the system
- **Legend**: Updated to include exempted absence indicators

### 3. Statistics Indicators
- **Notice Banner**: Shows when exempted absences are included in calculations
- **Updated Tooltips**: Explain that exempted absences count as "present" for analytics
- **Separate Counts**: Exempted absences are shown separately from regular absences

### 4. Grid and Table Layouts
- **Consistent Indicators**: Both layouts show exempted absence badges and tooltips
- **Rank Icons**: Trophy icons for top 3 students
- **Color Coding**: Consistent amber color scheme for exempted absences
- **Detailed Breakdowns**: Show exempted counts separately from regular absences

## Changes Made

### 1. New Utility Functions (`src/utils/attendanceCalculations.ts`)

Created centralized utility functions for consistent attendance calculations:

- `calculateAttendanceBreakdown()` - Calculates attendance statistics with exempted absences counted as attended
- `calculateAbsenceBreakdown()` - Separates exempted absences from regular absences
- `calculateCurrentStreak()` - Calculates attendance streaks including exempted absences
- `isAttendedForAnalytics()` - Helper function to check if a record counts as attended
- `getAttendanceColor()` - Utility for consistent attendance color coding

### 2. Updated Statistics Calculator (`src/components/attendance/leaderboard/utils/statisticsCalculator.ts`)

- Modified to use new utility functions
- Exempted absences now count as attended for percentage calculations
- Streak calculations include exempted absences
- Session breakdowns separate exempted from regular absences

### 3. Updated Attendance Statistics (`src/components/attendance/AttendanceStatistics.tsx`)

- Uses new utility functions for consistent calculations
- Exempted absences counted as attended in epic and session statistics
- Updated tooltips to explain the new calculation logic
- Modified StatisticItem component to support ReactNode titles for better tooltips
- Added notice banner when exempted absences are present

### 4. Updated Session Statistics (`src/components/attendance/SessionStatistics.tsx`)

- Uses new utility functions for session-specific calculations
- Exempted absences treated as attended for session attendance percentages
- Updated absence breakdowns to separate exempted from regular absences

### 5. Updated Student Dashboard (`src/pages/dashboards/student/components/AttendanceOverview.tsx`)

- Modified student statistics calculations to include exempted absences as attended
- Updated ranking calculations to treat exempted absences as attended for all students
- Streak calculations now include exempted absences

### 6. Updated StatisticItem Component (`src/components/common/statistics/StatisticItem.tsx`)

- Modified to accept `ReactNode` for title prop to support interactive tooltips
- This enables better user experience with detailed explanations

### 7. Enhanced Attendance Table (`src/components/attendance/AttendanceTable.tsx`)

- Added shield badges for students with exempted absences
- Updated button text to show "Exempted" when applicable
- Added detailed tooltips explaining exempted absences
- Color-coded exempted absences with amber theme

### 8. Enhanced Leaderboard Components

#### Table Layout (`src/components/attendance/leaderboard/layouts/TableLayout.tsx`)
- Added shield badges with exempted absence counts
- Info icons next to attendance percentages
- Detailed tooltips explaining impact on rankings
- Separate exempted absence counts in absence column

#### Grid Layout (`src/components/attendance/leaderboard/layouts/GridLayout.tsx`)
- Added shield badges with exempted absence counts
- Info icons next to attendance percentages
- Detailed tooltips explaining impact on rankings
- Separate exempted absence counts in absence section

#### Main Leaderboard (`src/components/attendance/AttendanceLeaderboard.tsx`)
- Added notice banner when exempted absences are present
- Updated legend to include exempted absence indicators
- Added "Learn more" tooltip explaining the system

## Database Schema

The database schema remains unchanged. Exempted absences are still stored as:
- `status = 'absent'`
- `absence_type = 'exempted'`

This maintains data integrity while allowing the application layer to interpret exempted absences differently for analytics.

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests (`src/utils/attendanceCalculations.test.ts`) that verify:

- Exempted absences are counted as attended for analytics
- Attendance percentages are calculated correctly
- Streak calculations include exempted absences
- Absence breakdowns separate exempted from regular absences
- Utility functions handle edge cases properly

## Impact

### Before Fix
- Exempted absences reduced attendance percentages
- Exempted absences broke attendance streaks
- Leaderboards showed inaccurate rankings
- Statistics included exempted absences in absence counts
- No visual indicators for exempted absences
- Users couldn't understand the impact on rankings

### After Fix
- Exempted absences count as attended for analytics
- Exempted absences maintain attendance streaks
- Leaderboards show accurate attendance-based rankings
- Statistics separate exempted absences for better insights
- Program managers can exempt students without penalizing their attendance record
- Clear visual indicators show when students have exempted absences
- Detailed tooltips explain the impact on rankings and calculations
- Notice banners inform users about exempted absences in the system

## Usage

Program managers can now mark students as absent with the "exempted" absence type for legitimate reasons such as:

- Medical emergencies
- Family emergencies
- Official school events
- Other approved absences

These exempted absences will not negatively impact the student's attendance record in analytics, leaderboards, or statistics. The system provides clear visual feedback about exempted absences and their impact on calculations.

## Visual Indicators Summary

| Component | Indicator | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Attendance Table | Shield Badge | Shows "Exempted" badge next to student name |
| Attendance Table | Button Text | "Absent" button changes to "Exempted" |
| Attendance Table | Tooltip | Shows reason and impact of exempted absence |
| Leaderboard | Shield Badge | Shows count of exempted absences |
| Leaderboard | Info Icon | Small icon next to attendance percentage |
| Leaderboard | Notice Banner | Explains exempted absences when present |
| Statistics | Notice Banner | Shows when exempted absences are included |
| All Components | Color Scheme | Consistent amber/orange theme for exempted |

## Migration

No database migration is required. The changes are purely at the application layer, ensuring backward compatibility with existing data.
