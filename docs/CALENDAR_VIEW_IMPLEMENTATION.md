- **Blue**: ‚â•75% attendance (Good)
- **Yellow**: ‚â•60% attendance (Fair)
- **Red**: <60% attendance (Needs Improvement)
- **Gray**: No sessions scheduled

### üìà Monthly Statistics

- Days with sessions count
- Average attendance percentage
- Total days in month

### ‚ö° Quick Actions

- Mark selected date as holiday
- Navigate to specific dates by clicking
- Previous/Next month navigation

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`src/pages/cohort-attendance/components/CalendarView.tsx`**
   - New component for calendar display
   - Handles date navigation and attendance visualization
   - Integrates with existing attendance data

2. **`src/pages/cohort-attendance/components/SessionManagementHeader.tsx`**
   - Added calendar button to view switcher
   - Updated view types to include 'calendar'
   - Updated header text for calendar view

3. **`src/pages/cohort-attendance/hooks/useAttendancePageState.ts`**
   - Extended view state to include 'calendar'
   - Maintains existing state management patterns

4. **`src/pages/CohortAttendancePage.tsx`**
   - Integrated CalendarView component
   - Added calendar view to content area logic

5. **`src/pages/cohort-attendance/components/index.ts`**
   - Added CalendarView export

### Component Architecture

```typescript
interface CalendarViewProps {
  selectedDate: Date;
  attendanceRecords: AttendanceRecord[];
  currentEpic: CohortEpic | null;
  isHoliday: boolean;
  currentHoliday: CohortEpic | null;
  onDateSelect: (date: Date) => void;
  onMarkHoliday: () => void;
}
```

### Data Flow

1. **Attendance Records**: Fetched from existing `useAttendanceData` hook
2. **Date Selection**: Updates parent component's selected date
3. **Holiday Management**: Integrates with existing holiday dialog
4. **Navigation**: Clicking dates switches to manage view for that date

## Usage

### For Users

1. Navigate to any cohort attendance page
2. Click the "Calendar" button in the view switcher (between Manage and Leaderboard)
3. View monthly attendance overview
4. Click on any date to navigate to that day's manage view
5. Use "Mark as Holiday" button to set holidays

### For Developers

The calendar view reuses existing data hooks and state management, making it consistent with the rest of the application. No additional API calls are required.

## Technical Notes

- **Responsive Design**: Calendar adapts to different screen sizes
- **Performance**: Uses `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- **Accessibility**: Includes proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Type Safety**: Fully typed with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Uses Shad CN UI components for consistency

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Holiday detection integration
- [ ] Bulk attendance operations
- [ ] Export calendar data
- [ ] Custom date ranges
- [ ] Attendance trend indicators
- [ ] Student-specific calendar views

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:

- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation
- ‚úÖ Component rendering
- ‚úÖ State management integration
- ‚úÖ Navigation functionality
- ‚úÖ Responsive design

## Dependencies

- `date-fns` - Date manipulation and formatting
