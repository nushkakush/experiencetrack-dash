# User Management System Plan

## Overview

A comprehensive user management system for the LIT OS admin dashboard that allows super admins to manage users, assign roles, and control access permissions. The system will be built with a clean, minimal UI using Shad CN components and will integrate seamlessly with the existing role-based permission system.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure

- **Database Schema**: Profiles table with user_id, first_name, last_name, email, role, created_at, updated_at
- **Role System**: 6 predefined roles (student, super_admin, program_manager, fee_collector, partnerships_head, placement_coordinator)
- **Permission System**: Feature-based permissions with granular control
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth integration
- **UI Framework**: Shad CN components with Tailwind CSS

### Current Limitations

- No dedicated user management interface
- SuperAdminDashboard has placeholder for User Management
- No bulk user operations
- Limited user search and filtering capabilities

## System Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **User Listing & Search**
   - Display all users in a paginated table
   - Search by name, email, role
   - Filter by role, status, date range
   - Sort by any column

2. **User Operations**
   - View user details
   - Edit user information (name, email, role)
   - Delete users (with confirmation)
   - Bulk operations (delete, role assignment)

3. **Role Management**
   - Assign/change user roles
   - View role permissions
   - Bulk role assignment

4. **User Status Management**
   - Activate/deactivate users
   - Reset user passwords
   - View user activity

5. **Audit & Logging**
   - Track user changes
   - View user activity logs
   - Export user data

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Handle 1000+ users efficiently
- **Security**: Role-based access control
- **Usability**: Intuitive, responsive design
- **Scalability**: Support future role additions

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- User activity logging
CREATE TABLE user_activity_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  details JSONB,
  performed_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);

-- User status tracking
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN status TEXT DEFAULT 'active' CHECK (status IN ('active', 'inactive', 'suspended'));
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN last_login TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN login_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```
