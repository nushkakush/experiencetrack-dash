# Payment Communication System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive email and WhatsApp notification system for student payment flows. The system ensures that students receive timely notifications at every stage of their payment process, but only if they have explicitly enabled communications.

## Communication Preferences

All notifications are only sent to students who have enabled communications in their preferences:

- **Email**: `communication_preferences.automated_communications.email.enabled = true`
- **WhatsApp**: `communication_preferences.automated_communications.whatsapp.enabled = true`

## Email Triggers & Templates

### 1. Payment Submitted Successfully

- **Trigger**: Student submits a payment
- **Subject**: "Payment Submitted Successfully - Verification Pending"
- **Content**: Confirms payment submission and sets expectations for verification timeline
- **Location**: `PaymentTransactionService.ts:175`

### 2. Payment Approved (Full Amount)

- **Trigger**: Admin approves a payment in full
- **Subject**: "Payment Approved - Receipt Generated"
- **Content**: Confirms payment approval and receipt generation
- **Location**: `paymentTransaction.service.ts:358` & `partial-payments.ts:280`
- **Note**: Also checks if this completes the installment and sends "All Payments Completed" email

### 3. Payment Rejected

- **Trigger**: Admin rejects a payment
- **Subject**: "Payment Rejected - Action Required"
- **Content**: Explains rejection reason and next steps
- **Location**: `paymentTransaction.service.ts:393` & `partial-payments.ts:200`

### 4. Partial Payment Submitted

- **Trigger**: Admin marks a payment as partially approved
- **Subject**: "Partial Payment Submitted - Verification Pending"
- **Content**: Confirms partial payment submission
- **Location**: `paymentTransaction.service.ts:550`

### 5. Payment Partially Approved

- **Trigger**: Admin marks a payment as partially approved
- **Subject**: "Payment Partially Approved - Balance Due"
- **Content**: Shows approved amount, remaining balance, and next steps
- **Location**: `paymentTransaction.service.ts:477` & `partial-payments.ts:425`

### 6. All Payments Completed

- **Trigger**: Installment is fully paid (either through partial approval or direct full payment)
- **Subject**: "Installment Completed - All Payments Approved"
- **Content**: Confirms installment completion with payment summary
- **Location**:
  - Partial approval: `paymentTransaction.service.ts:580`
  - Direct full payment: `paymentTransaction.service.ts:375` & `partial-payments.ts:310`

### 7. ~~Receipt Generated~~ (REMOVED - Redundant)

- **Status**: ❌ **DISABLED** - This email was redundant with "Payment Approved"
- **Reason**: Both emails were sent when a payment was approved, causing confusion

### 8. Payment Submission Failed

- **Trigger**: Student payment submission fails
- **Subject**: "Payment Submission Failed - Action Required"
- **Content**: Explains the error and next steps
- **Location**: `PaymentTransactionService.ts:136`

## Email Signature

All emails use the standardized signature:

```
Admissions Team,
LIT School
```

## Technical Implementation

### Services Architecture

1. **PaymentCommunicationService**: Core email sending logic
2. **WhatsAppCommunicationService**: WhatsApp message templates (ready for future integration)
3. **UnifiedPaymentCommunicationService**: Orchestrates both email and WhatsApp
4. **CommunicationPreferencesService**: Checks if student has enabled communications

### Database Integration

- **Tables**: `payment_transactions`, `student_payments`, `cohort_students`, `communication_preferences`
- **Edge Functions**: `payment-engine` handles admin-initiated payment verifications
- **API Services**: Handle student-initiated payments and direct API calls

### Error Handling

- Communication failures don't disrupt the main payment flow
- All errors are logged for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks ensure payment processing continues

## Recent Fixes

### ✅ Fixed: "All Payments Completed" Email Logic

**Problem**: Email was only sent during partial approval, not when students paid the full amount directly.

**Solution**: Added logic to detect when a direct full payment completes an installment:

```typescript
// Check if this payment completes the installment
const { data: studentPayment } = await supabase
  .from('student_payments')
  .select('total_amount_payable, total_amount_paid')
  .eq('id', transaction.student_payments.id)
  .single();

if (studentPayment) {
  const totalPaidAfterThisPayment =
    (studentPayment.total_amount_paid || 0) + transaction.amount;
  const isInstallmentComplete =
    totalPaidAfterThisPayment >= studentPayment.total_amount_payable;

  if (isInstallmentComplete) {
    // Send "All Payments Completed" email
  }
}
```

### ✅ Fixed: Removed Redundant "Receipt Generated" Email

**Problem**: Both "Payment Approved" and "Receipt Generated" emails were sent, causing confusion.

**Solution**: Removed the "Receipt Generated" email trigger. The "Payment Approved" email already mentions receipt generation.

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Student Pays Full Amount Directly

1. Student submits full payment → **Email #1: Payment Submitted**
2. Admin approves payment → **Email #2: Payment Approved** + **Email #6: All Payments Completed**

### Scenario 2: Student Makes Partial Payment

1. Student submits partial payment → **Email #1: Payment Submitted**
2. Admin partially approves → **Email #4: Partial Payment Submitted** + **Email #5: Payment Partially Approved**
3. Student submits remaining amount → **Email #1: Payment Submitted**
4. Admin approves remaining amount → **Email #2: Payment Approved** + **Email #6: All Payments Completed**

### Scenario 3: Payment Rejection

1. Student submits payment → **Email #1: Payment Submitted**
2. Admin rejects payment → **Email #3: Payment Rejected**

### Scenario 4: Payment Submission Failure

1. Student attempts payment but it fails → **Email #8: Payment Submission Failed**
