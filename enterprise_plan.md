# Enterprise Architecture Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive audit of the codebase, this plan outlines critical refactoring initiatives to transform this application into an enterprise-grade system. The current codebase shows signs of rapid development with technical debt that requires systematic resolution to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

**Current State Issues:**

- 530 TypeScript/React files with only 313 test files (59% test coverage deficit)
- Multiple 500+ line components (largest: 969 lines)
- 792 React Hook usages indicating potential over-complexity
- 27 Dialog components with significant duplication
- Direct Supabase API calls scattered throughout components
- Hardcoded configuration values including public keys in source
- Limited code memoization and performance optimization

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. 🚨 **File Size & Maintainability Crisis**

**Issues:**

- `CohortStudentsTable.tsx` (969 lines) - Monolithic component with multiple responsibilities
- `PaymentSchedule.tsx` (622 lines) - Complex payment logic mixed with UI
- `usePaymentSubmissions.ts` (602 lines) - Oversized hook with multiple concerns
- Multiple 400-600 line files across the codebase

**Impact:** High maintenance cost, difficult code reviews, hard to test, onboarding complexity

### 2. 🔄 **Component & Logic Duplication**

**Issues:**

- 27 Dialog components with similar patterns but no shared abstraction
- Payment form validation logic repeated across multiple components
- Authentication state management duplicated in multiple places
- Similar table rendering patterns across cohorts, payments, and attendance
- Toast notification patterns repeated 264+ times across 57 files

**Impact:** Inconsistent UX, maintenance overhead, bug multiplication

### 3. 📊 **State Management Chaos**

**Issues:**

- Mix of React hooks, Zustand stores, and React Query with no clear pattern
- Prop drilling evident in large component hierarchies
- 792 useState/useEffect/useCallback/useMemo usages indicating complex state trees
- No centralized state management strategy

**Impact:** Performance issues, hard to debug, state consistency problems

### 4. 🌐 **API Architecture Problems**

**Issues:**

- Direct Supabase calls in 13 different files without abstraction
- No consistent error handling patterns
- Limited use of React Query (only 48 matches) for data fetching
- API calls mixed directly in components instead of service layer

**Impact:** Poor error handling, no caching strategy, hard to test, vendor lock-in

### 5. 🔒 **Security Vulnerabilities**

**Issues:**

- Supabase public key hardcoded in source code
- Use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and `innerHTML` in components
- 753 instances of sensitive keywords (password, token, key, auth) scattered throughout code
- No proper secret management

**Impact:** Security risks, compliance issues, potential data breaches

### 6. ⚡ **Performance & Bundle Size Issues**

**Issues:**

- Only 16 components using `React.memo` optimization
- No lazy loading implementation for routes
- Large number of imports indicating potential bundle size issues
- No code splitting strategy evident

**Impact:** Slow load times, poor user experience, high bandwidth usage

### 7. 🧪 **Testing Deficiencies**

**Issues:**

- 313 test files for 530 source files (59% coverage)
- Limited integration testing evident
- No apparent test strategy for complex state interactions

**Impact:** Regression risks, poor code quality confidence, difficult refactoring
