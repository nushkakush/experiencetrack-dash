# Student Details Components

This directory contains the refactored components for the student details functionality, specifically the PaymentSchedule and AdminPaymentRecordingDialog components which were broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

## Components

### PaymentSchedule.tsx
The main component that orchestrates all the payment schedule functionality. It uses the `usePaymentSchedule` hook for state management and renders smaller, focused components.

### PaymentScheduleItem.tsx
A focused component that renders individual payment schedule items, including:
- Payment type and status display
- Amount and due date information
- Record payment button (for admins)
- Partial payment toggle
- Payment transaction history

### PaymentScheduleEmptyState.tsx
A focused component for the empty state when no payment plan is selected, including:
- Informative message about payment plan selection
- Preview of different payment plan types (One-Shot, Semester-wise, Installment-wise)

### PaymentScheduleLoadingState.tsx
A focused component for the loading state with skeleton animations.

### PaymentScheduleNoPaymentsState.tsx
A focused component for when no payments are scheduled yet.

### PaymentBreakdownCard.tsx
A focused component for displaying payment breakdown information in the AdminPaymentRecordingDialog, including:
- Base fee, GST, discount, and scholarship amounts
- Partial payment calculations
- Loading states with skeleton animations

### AdminDialogHeader.tsx
A focused component for the dialog header in AdminPaymentRecordingDialog, including:
- Student name and payment type display
- Close button functionality

## Hooks

### hooks/usePaymentSchedule.ts
A custom hook that encapsulates all the state management and business logic for the PaymentSchedule component, including:
- Payment schedule calculation and fetching
- Payment transaction management
- Payment recording functionality
- Status and permission checking
- Complex payment engine integration

### hooks/useAdminPaymentRecording.ts
A custom hook that encapsulates all the state management and business logic for the AdminPaymentRecordingDialog component, including:
- Payment breakdown calculation and fetching
- Transaction management and pending amount calculations
- Payment submission handling
- Complex payment engine integration for different payment types

## Utils

### utils/paymentScheduleUtils.ts
Utility functions for formatting and status handling:
- `formatCurrency` - Format amounts in Indian Rupees
- `formatDate` - Format dates in Indian locale
- `getStatusBadge` - Generate status badges with appropriate styling

### utils/adminPaymentUtils.ts
Utility functions for admin payment dialog formatting and status handling:
- `formatCurrency` - Format amounts in Indian Rupees
- `formatDate` - Format dates in Indian locale
- `getStatusBadge` - Generate status badges with appropriate styling

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component now has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and fix issues in specific functionality
4. **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to unit test
5. **Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand
6. **Performance**: Smaller components can be optimized independently

## Usage

The main entry point is the `PaymentSchedule` component, which can be used in student detail pages:

```tsx
import { PaymentSchedule } from '@/components/fee-collection/components/student-details/PaymentSchedule';

<PaymentSchedule
  student={student}
  feeStructure={feeStructure}
/>
```

All other components are internal to the payment schedule functionality and are used by the main `PaymentSchedule` component.

## Refactoring Summary

### PaymentSchedule Component:
**Before:**
- One massive file with 744 lines
- Mixed concerns (UI, business logic, state management, complex calculations)
- Difficult to maintain and test

**After:**
- **5 focused components** with clear responsibilities
- **1 custom hook** for state management
- **1 utility file** for shared functions
- **1 index file** for clean exports

### AdminPaymentRecordingDialog Component:
**Before:**
- One massive file with 701 lines
- Mixed concerns (UI, business logic, state management, complex calculations)
- Difficult to maintain and test

**After:**
- **2 focused components** with clear responsibilities
- **1 custom hook** for state management
- **1 utility file** for shared functions

### Overall After Refactoring:
- **7 focused components** with clear responsibilities
- **2 custom hooks** for state management
- **2 utility files** for shared functions
- **1 index file** for clean exports
- **1 README** for documentation

The refactored code maintains all the original functionality while being much more maintainable and following React best practices for component composition and separation of concerns.
