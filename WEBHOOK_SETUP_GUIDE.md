# Webflow Webhook Setup Guide

This guide will help you configure Webflow to send form submissions directly to your database in real-time, eliminating the need for manual syncing.

## What We've Built

âœ… **Webhook Edge Function**: `webflow-enquiry-webhook` deployed to Supabase
âœ… **Real-time Processing**: Form submissions are processed immediately
âœ… **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate enquiries from being created
âœ… **Form Type Detection**: Automatically detects and maps different form types
âœ… **Test Component**: Built-in testing interface in the enquiries page

## Webhook URL

Your webhook endpoint is:

```
https://ghmpaghyasyllfvamfna.supabase.co/functions/v1/webflow-enquiry-webhook
```

## Step 1: Configure Webflow Webhook

### Option A: Using Webflow Designer (Recommended)

1. **Open your Webflow project** in the Designer
2. **Go to Project Settings** â†’ **Integrations** â†’ **Webhooks**
3. **Click "Add Webhook"**
4. **Configure the webhook:**
   - **Name**: `Enquiry Form Submissions`
   - **URL**: `https://ghmpaghyasyllfvamfna.supabase.co/functions/v1/webflow-enquiry-webhook`
   - **Events**: Select "Form Submission"
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Headers**:
     ```
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```

### Option B: Using Webflow API

If you prefer to set up via API, you can use this curl command:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.webflow.com/v2/sites/YOUR_SITE_ID/webhooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "accept-version: 1.0.0" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "triggerType": "form_submission",
    "url": "https://ghmpaghyasyllfvamfna.supabase.co/functions/v1/webflow-enquiry-webhook",
    "filter": {
      "formId": "YOUR_FORM_ID"
    }
  }'
```

## Step 2: Test the Webhook

1. **Open your Enquiries page** in the dashboard
2. **Click "Test Webhook"** button in the header
3. **Fill out the test form** with sample data
4. **Click "Test Webhook"** to send a test submission
5. **Check the enquiries list** to see if the new enquiry appears

## Step 3: Verify Real-time Processing

1. **Submit a real form** on your Webflow site
2. **Check the enquiries page** - the enquiry should appear immediately
3. **No manual sync needed** - data flows directly from form to database

## Supported Form Types

The webhook automatically handles these form types:

### 1. Contact Form

- **Fields**: name, email, phone, age, professional status, location, career goals, course interest, UTM parameters
- **Mapping**: Maps all standard contact form fields

### 2. Program files-Brochure

- **Fields**: First Name, Email, Phone, Age, Professional Status
- **Mapping**: Simplified mapping for brochure download forms

### 3. Email Form

- **Fields**: Email, UTM parameters
- **Mapping**: Email-only forms with marketing tracking

## Webhook Payload Structure

The webhook expects this payload format from Webflow:

```json
{
  "name": "Form Submission",
  "site": "your-site-id",
  "data": {
    "id": "submission-id",
    "formId": "form-id",
    "siteId": "site-id",
    "formResponse": {
      "field1": "value1",
      "field2": "value2"
    },
    "dateSubmitted": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  },
  "createdOn": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Data

1. **Check Webflow webhook configuration** - ensure URL is correct
2. **Verify form submissions** - test with a real form submission
3. **Check Supabase logs** - look for webhook function logs
4. **Test with the built-in test component** - use the test interface

### Duplicate Enquiries

- The webhook includes duplicate prevention
- Checks for same email + submission date
- Prevents exact duplicates and same-day duplicates

### Form Data Not Mapping Correctly

1. **Check form field names** in Webflow
2. **Verify form type detection** - ensure form names match expected values
